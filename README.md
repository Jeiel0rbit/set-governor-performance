> **Set Linux CPU frequency scaling governor to 'performance' mode with automatic persistence across reboots using systemd.**

## üöÄ Overview

This script provides a robust, safe, and easy-to-use way to set your Linux system's CPU frequency governor to "performance" mode permanently. Since some distros may not recognize performance mode, this script sets it up. Unlike temporary workarounds that disappear after a reboot, this tool creates a systemd service that ensures that CPU governor settings are maintained across reboots, suspend/resume cycles, and system updates.

### Why Use This Tool?

- **üîí Secure**: Follows security best practices with least privilege principle
- **üîÑ Persistent**: Automatic configuration on every boot via systemd
- **üñ•Ô∏è Multi-CPU**: Supports systems with multiple CPUs and cores
- **üìä Comprehensive**: Detailed logging, status reporting, and error handling
- **üéØ Professional**: Production-ready with proper error handling and rollback
- **üîß Flexible**: Easy installation, status checking, and uninstallation

## üîê Security

This project prioritizes security and follows industry best practices:

### Script Security

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Runs as regular user, elevates only when necessary
- **Input Validation**: All parameters and system state validated before execution
- **Path Security**: Uses absolute paths to prevent PATH injection attacks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with secure cleanup
- **Secure Permissions**: Files created with appropriate permissions (644/755)

### systemd Service Security

The created systemd service includes multiple security hardening measures:

```ini
NoNewPrivileges=yes          # Prevents privilege escalation
ProtectSystem=strict         # Read-only filesystem protection
ProtectKernelModules=yes    # Prevents kernel module loading
RestrictRealtime=yes        # Prevents realtime scheduling
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes  # Prevents code injection
```

### Security Audit

Regular security audits ensure the script maintains high security standards:

- Static analysis with ShellCheck
- Permission validation
- Input sanitization testing
- Privilege escalation prevention

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "cpufreq not available"

```bash
[ERROR] cpufreq is not available on this system.
```

**Solution**: Your kernel may not have CPUfreq support enabled, or the appropriate driver isn't loaded.

```bash
# Check if CPUfreq is available
ls /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/

# Load appropriate driver (AMD)
sudo modprobe acpi-cpufreq

# Load appropriate driver (Intel)
sudo modprobe intel_pstate
```

#### Issue: "Performance governor not available"

```bash
[ERROR] The 'performance' governor is not available on this system.
```

**Solution**: Check available governors and verify system support:

```bash
# Check available governors
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors

# If performance is missing, you may need to enable it in kernel config
```

#### Issue: "sudo permissions required"

```bash
[ERROR] Sudo permissions required to continue.
```

**Solution**: Ensure your user has sudo privileges:

```bash
# Add user to sudo group (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo usermod -aG sudo $USER

# Add user to wheel group (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora)
sudo usermod -aG wheel $USER

# Then logout and login again
```

### Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check Compatibility**: Verify your system meets the requirements above
2. **Run Verbose Mode**: Use `--verbose` flag for detailed output
3. **Check Logs**: Review systemd logs with `journalctl`
4. **Report Issues**: Create an issue on GitHub with system information
